## TokenTracker Pricing and Usage Algorithms

`src/usage-pricing/matcher.js`, `src/usage-pricing/curated-overrides.json`,
`src/usage-pricing/seed-snapshot.json`, and parts of the token normalization
and pricing behavior are derived from TokenTracker.

Runtime pricing data is fetched from two public sources by
`src/pricing-updater.js`: the **LiteLLM** price list
(<https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm>, MIT — also the origin of the bundled
`seed-snapshot.json`) and the **OpenRouter** models API
(<https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models>) for models LiteLLM does not carry.
Curated overrides always take precedence over fetched data, which is used only
to estimate usage cost.
